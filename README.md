REFLECTION: This project took me from around eight hours to complete over the span of a couple of days. I first had to figure out how I would create fish and move them around with a variable path. I also had to move fish around in different areas and be able to count if they were caught or not and add them to the score, which I initially made incorrectly. After getting the fish to move and create a score through PVectors, the rest of the effort was to create menus and optimal inputs for the game.
